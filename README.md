The article [New Chrome security features seek to better protect user privacy] (https://sdtimes.com/security/new-chrome-security-features-seek-to-better-protect-user-privacy/) is interesting.

The interesting I found is this new security feature will now offer the ability for users to grant website permissions for a single visit to the site. For instance, a user could grant the site access to the phoneâ€™s mic, and then once the user leaves the site, Chrome revokes the permission and the site will have to ask again the next time they visit.
